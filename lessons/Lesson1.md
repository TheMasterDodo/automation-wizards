Lesson 1 -> Introduction to Slack & Tech Stack
==============================================

Slack
-----

Slack is a bussiness-oriented messaging application. Think of it as Whatsapp or Messenger overloaded with more features.
Unlike Whatsapp, it has a public API which helps provide support for creating bots and other applications to automate your workflow.
We will be working with the Slack API to communicate with our bot once we have installed it on Slack

Elixir
------

Elixir is a functional programming language based on Erlang. Think of Elixir as similar to Racket (for those who know - but no where near as awful).
Most of the groundwork for the bot (web routing, etc) has been setup already and so we won't be going into too much detail about that.

Phoenix 
-------

Phoenix is a web routing framework that is made to work very well with Elixir. Think of it as a framework which routes traffic from your application (bot) to Slack and vice versa.
We won't be going over Phoenix and how it works but towards the end we can dive in to it deeper if need be.

Plan for Today
--------------

1. Get everyone setup and installed on the Slack workspace
2. Clone github repo and setup IDE of choice
3. Create our own bot on Slack and explore Slack API
4. Walk through codebase and start coding!
