Week 3
======

## Roadmap

1. Git Student Developer Pack

2. Git Crash Course

3. Making our own feature branch + responder

## Breakdown of Tasks

GitHub offers a Student Developer Pack with unlimited free private repositories for students at eligible Canadian Universities. I recommend setting this up if you haven't done so already, you can find the link below under *important links*

To gain familiarity with version control, we will each be creating our own local branch which we will work on when creating our responder. Once complete, we will learn how to create pull requests and conduct code reviews to merge our changes back to the master branch.

Once all branches are merged back into master, we will have a branch *(master)* with all the responders that you have created. Doing a ```git pull``` after this will pull all the responders created into your local code.


## Git Instructions

1. Navigate to the repository homepage *(https://github.com/muneebazam/Wizards-of-Automation)*

2. Click on the *branch* button, enter the name of the branch you wish to create and press *create*

3. Open up the project location in command line and switch to the branch you just created: ```git checkout <branch_name>```

4. 

### Git
1. Get your Git accounts setup
2. Add as collaborators 
3. Create a branch for your project
