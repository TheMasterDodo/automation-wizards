Week 3
======

## Schedule for Today

1. Recap of Week 2
2. Git Know-How

## Breakdown of Tasks

To gain familiarity with version control, we will each be creating our own local branch which we will work on when creating our responder. Once complete, we will learn how to create pull requests and conduct code reviews to merge our changes back to the master branch.

Pattern matching is the act of checking a given sequence of tokens for the presence of the constituents of some pattern. We will discuss delimiter characters and look at diferrent RegEx expressions. 

Lastlly, we will look at how a Hedwig responder works and get a chance to build our own responder which matches RegEx expessions in order to respond in Slack. Once complete, we will create pull requests and code review one anothers requests before merging back to master.
