Week 4
======

## Roadmap

1. Responders & Regular Expressions

2. Slack API Demo

3. Using our bot to send HTTP requests

## Breakdown of Tasks

Today we will dive deeper into responders, as well as see what regex is, and how we use it to match patterns of text.

A regular expression is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Usually used by string sarching algorithms, our responders will use regex to match certain phrases they are looking for. Regex is best learnt through examples so head over to the following link to learn more: *https://regexr.com/* 

The bulk of today will be a live demo on how to send HTTP requests and interact with the Slack API.
