# Wizards-of-Automation
An introduction to Bots and Automation. 
Offered as a part of Coffee N' Code F18 *(http://uwcoffeencode.com/)*


## Overview

This project will walk you through how to get a Slack bot up and running. This bot will be taught to listen and reply to simple commands such as tell you the weather, date, or what classes you have today. We will also look into how to automate processes with our bot by using a cron-job-like scheduler *(quantum)* so that it can send us reminders and notifications.

This project will also cover the basics of Git as each person will be creating their own feature branch which we will merge back into master at the end of the project, giving us a 'super' bot with everyones features.

1. Elixir *(Language)*
2. Phoenix *(Web Routing Framework)*
