# Wizards-of-Automation
An introduction to Bots and Automation. 

This project will walk you through how to get a simple bot for a social media platform up and running. This bot will know how to listen and reply to simple phrases such as tell you the weather, date, or what classes you have today. We will also look into how to automate processes with our bot by using a 'cron-job' scheduler so that it can send us reminders and notifications.


## Tech Stack

1. Elixir (Language)
2. Phoenix (Web Routing Framework)
3. Slack (Social Platform)



## Weekly Schedule

The project will consist of approximately 6-7 workshops, with each workshop building upon previous content.
