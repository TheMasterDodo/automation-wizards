# Wizards-of-Automation
An introduction to Bots and Automation. 


## Overview

This project will walk you through how to get a Slack bot up and running. This bot will be taught to listen and reply to simple commands such as tell you the weather, date, or what classes you have today. We will also look into how to automate processes with our bot by using a cron-job-like scheduler *(quantum)* so that it can send us reminders and notifications.


## Tech Stack

1. Elixir *(Language)*
2. Phoenix *(Web Routing Framework)*
3. Slack *(Platform)*


## Weekly Schedule

The project will consist of six 90-minute workshops every Wednesday (with the exception of midterm week) from 6:30-8:00pm in Engineering 7 *(Behind E5 building)*
